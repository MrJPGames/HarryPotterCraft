# HarryPotterCraft
This is HPC it's still very much in alpha, and work has stopped on this project. It should work on Mincraft version 1.6.2, both Client and Server side.

This was made a long time ago, hence why it's for a outdated version of Minecraft. I was still learning to code back then, so it's probably full of bad practises, bugs and other stuff. Also since this is outdated and the way Minecraft does things has changed quite a bit (especially textures) this will not work on newer versions with minor tweaking of the code.
